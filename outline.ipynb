    "## Intro\n",
    "A novel approach for muons identification and track parameter estimation [[1]] consists in the implementation of an algorithm mixing artificial neural networks\n",
    "and analytical methods on a FPGA. This algorithm is being tested on a\n",
    "cosmic muon telescope at the Legnaro INFN National Laboratory (LNL), a detector composed by a\n",
    "set of drift-tubes (DT) reproducing a small-scale replica of those in use at CMS. \n",

    "- Description of the experimental setup -> [[2]] chapter 1 (1.2.1 explain the actual configuration) \n",
    "- How we track muons using scintillator signals -> [[2]] section 2.2, 2.4 + chapter 3\n",

    "1. Build a 2D dataset with t<sub>drift</sub> and the crossing angle &theta; as features\n",
    "   * using scintillator signals\n",
    "   * using the ML algorithm reconstruction hidden within data\n",
    "2. Study the correlation between the two features \n",
    "3. Test the performance of \"the algorithm\" (we should find a name for that algorithm) using the 2D dataset built in 1.\n",
    "   * NN architecture &rarr; more complex than 1x3x1 (maybe 2x3x3 or 2x5x5)\n",
    "   * What is the average training time for the algorithm?\n",
    "   * If we put a constraint on the crossing angle, does the algorithm detect the anomaly in the drift time distribution or it correctly sees the correlation between the two features?\n",
